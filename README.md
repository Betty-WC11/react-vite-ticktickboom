# Tick...Tick...Boom! 💣

The game is a React-based guessing game where the player has to guess the correct number among 100 tiles to stop the bomb from exploding.

## About the Game

Tick...Tick...Boom! is an interactive guessing game built as a learning project to practice React fundamentals and component based architecture.

Prior to building, I created a UI Design for the game. After the build it turned out slightly different to the initial design, however the design worked really well as a guideline. <br>
